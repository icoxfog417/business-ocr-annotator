# Cursor Rules for Business OCR Annotator

**IMPORTANT**: Always read and follow the guidelines in `CLAUDE.md` for all development tasks. This file provides a quick reference, but `CLAUDE.md` is the authoritative source.

## Quick Reference

### Project Structure
- **Specifications**: All project specs are in `spec/` directory:
  - `spec/requirements.md` - User experience and features
  - `spec/design.md` - Architecture and component design
  - `spec/tasks.md` - Implementation task list
  - `spec/proposals/` - Design proposal documents (format: `yyyyMMdd_{name}.md`)
  - `spec/implementation_qa.md` - Technical Q&A from sandbox verification

### Before Making Changes
1. Review `spec/requirements.md`, `spec/design.md`, and `spec/tasks.md`
2. For new features: Create a proposal in `spec/proposals/` first
3. For technical questions: Use sandbox verification workflow (see `CLAUDE.md`)

### Code Quality
- Zero warnings policy: All code must pass linting
- Prettier auto-formatting: Single quotes, semicolons, 100 char width
- TypeScript strict mode: No `any` types without justification
- Pre-commit hooks enforce quality automatically

### Sandbox Workflow
- Question First: Document questions in `spec/implementation_qa.md` before creating sandbox
- Verify in `.sandbox/` before implementing production features
- Document findings in `spec/implementation_qa.md` with status (⏳ Pending / 🔬 In Progress / ✅ Verified)

## Full Guidelines

For complete workflow guidelines, specification management process, sandbox verification workflow, code quality standards, and all other project rules, **always refer to `CLAUDE.md`**.
